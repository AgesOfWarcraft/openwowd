# OpenWoWD
OpenWoWD is a cloud-friendly, private server-focused fork of [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore). This fork focuses on building features that are specifically beneficial to the private server community. 

## Supported Versions
* World of Warcraft: Legion (7.3.5)
 
## Usage
We do not support any other method of running OpenWoWD other than via Docker. This is by far the fastest method to actually run the software. You can get Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started), if you aren't already familiar with it.

Additional documentation (including examples) will be included shortly. :-)
